**Description**
This project is an MVP of a service for sharing autonomous
driving cars. End users will be able to see cars available for
reservation, filter according to their needs, and make reservations
for selected cars. Users will be able to access their information:
payment methods, past reservations, reservation (ride) in
progress.
